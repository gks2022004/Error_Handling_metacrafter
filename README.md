# Error Handling 

This smart contract demonstrates different error handling techniques using the `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements. It is important to properly handle errors in smart contracts to ensure the security and integrity of the blockchain.

## Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has three functions. The "requireExample" function shows the working of the "require" function. If the value of the variable y is equal to zero then the function will revert with the error message "Division by zero is not allowed". The "revertExample" function shows the working of the "revert" function. If the value of the variable y is equal to zero. In this case, the function will revert with the error message "Division by zero is not allowed.", the rest of the gas is refunded back to the account and the state updates are reverted. The "assertExample" function shows the working of the "assert" function.  

## Execution
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/
