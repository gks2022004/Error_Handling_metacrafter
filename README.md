# Error Handling Contract

This Solidity contract demonstrates different error handling techniques using the `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements. It is important to properly handle errors in smart contracts to ensure the security and integrity of the blockchain.

## Functions

### `requireExample(uint256 x, uint256 y)`

This function demonstrates the use of the `require` statement. It takes two `uint256` parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns the result of `x / y`. The `require` statement is used to check if `y` is not equal to zero before performing the division. If `y` is zero, the function will revert with the error message "Division by zero is not allowed."

### `assertExample(uint256 x, uint256 y)`

This function demonstrates the use of the `assert` statement. It takes two `uint256` parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns the result of `x / y`. The `assert` statement is used to check if `y` is not equal to zero before performing the division. If `y` is zero, the contract will revert with an assertion error.

### `revertExample(uint256 x, uint256 y)`

This function demonstrates the use of the `revert` statement. It takes two `uint256` parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns the result of `x / y`. The `revert` statement is used to manually revert the transaction if `y` is equal to zero. In this case, the function will revert with the error message "Division by zero is not allowed."
